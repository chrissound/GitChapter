## What problem does this solve?
Makes it easy to write technical article  while including files as annotations.

## Instructions
Change the hardcoded path `"/home/chris/Projects/Haskell/Articles/Rainbox"` and change it to a directory that follows the appropriate structure. TODO: Show example of appropriate structure

## Limitations
It's still a bit hacky but it appears to be working fine. The actual functionality is quite simple.
